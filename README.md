Job Board Project

The ideology behind the design of the application was to create a job board application titled Jobseeker that enables the user to search, store, and apply to a database of available jobs in a niche industry. We decided on the leveraging the Web developer  network as it is readily advertised online. The project required us to set up a database schema with the requirements for the data retrieved from the  JSearch API we utilised from rapidAPI. We mapped out the scope of the applications different webpage interfaces and rendered them using the templating engine (handlebars) to build the frontend and tie it to the backend. This application will use node JS , express, sequelize, and mySQL for dependencies on the server side. Further along we hope to expand the project to be able to implement an API with more functionality (i.e., job search based on parameters), as well as increase communication between job seeker and employer through virtual meeting spaces for interview purposes.
