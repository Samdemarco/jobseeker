## Description

JobSeeker is a job board that by using the [JSearch API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch/details) in the backend provides a list of jobs posted across the web in real-time from many major and minor job sites.

JobSeeker is a subscription based service. Once the user creates an account and inputs their profile information they can browse through the available jobs and apply to those of interest in one click.

The application uses: `Node.js`, `MySQL2`, `Express.js`, `Sequelize`, and `Handlebars` to implement the full-stack functionality.
