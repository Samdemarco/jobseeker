Job Board Project
The following project aims to create a job board application named Jobseeker that enables the user to search, store, and apply to a database of available jobs. The project required us to set up a database schema with the requirements for the data retrieved from the JSearch API  database. We mapped out the scope of the applications different webpage interfaces and rendered them using handlebars to build the frontend. This application will use node JS , express, sequelize, and mySQL for dependencies on the server side.
